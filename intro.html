        <p>
          My name is Shanel Locke. I am the owner and creator of my business Shanel Locke Fine Art &#169;. My professional experience is varied and eclectic. I have been a chef and previously dedicated twelve years of my life in the professional
          restaurant
          business, four of which was under the position of the captainâ€™s personal cook and baker on the USS Carl Vinson in the United States Navy. As a leader in the Navy, I learned to work well under lots of stressful situations by being creative
          and excelling at finding thoughtful and ethical solutions. When I obtained my G.I. Bill when separating honorably from the Navy, I completed three higher education degrees: a BA in Fine Art, a BA in Science in Health and Human Performance,
          and an AS in Culinary Arts. I used my education to become a certified K-12 educator and taught for four years until I decided to go back to college to become an Interactive Artist and Game Designer.</p>

          always grow and improve professionally in the workplace. I hope my talents, if you choose to hire me will provide you with a high level of professionalism that will help inspire new and existing clients. I welcome an opportunity to discuss
          with you personally how my skills and strengths can best serve your facility and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
